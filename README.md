Usage
To use this project, follow these instructions:

Start the application by running it on a web server (e.g., http://localhost:3000/model).
The application fetches car model data from the specified API and displays the first car's image along with a list of model names.
Click on a model name to view that car's image and details.
Use the arrow keys (Right and Left) to navigate through the car images.
Leave comments using the comment form.
How It Works
The project uses JavaScript to fetch car model data from the API and display it on a web page. It allows users to interact with the data by clicking on model names, navigating through images, and leaving comments.
