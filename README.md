# BMW Project

## Features

- View car models and their details.
- Navigate through car images using arrow keys.
- Leave comments on the car model.

## Usage

To use this project, follow these instructions:

1. Start the application by running it on a web server (e.g., `http://localhost:3000/model`).
2. The application fetches car model data from the specified API and displays the first car's image along with a list of model names.
3. Click on a model name to view that car's image and details.
4. Use the arrow keys (Right and Left) to navigate through the car images.
5. Leave comments using the comment form.

## How It Works

The project uses JavaScript to fetch car model data from the API and display it on a web page. It allows users to interact with the data by clicking on model names, navigating through images, and leaving comments.
